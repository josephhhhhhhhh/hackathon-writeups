Challenge: Crack a protected zip file password.

Process: The name implies using tools like hashcat and JtR to complete this challenge.
1) Generate a hash of the protected zip using zip2john
2) Remove the file information at the start and end of the hash so that hashcat can process it
3) Run hashcat with params `-a 0 -m 17200 ziphash.txt rockyou.txt` where attack mode 0 is a dictionary attack, and zip compression used is 17200 -> which is pkzip(compressed). Downloaded the rockyou.txt wordlist to run the dict attack.
4) Password was 123mango. Cracked relatively quickly.
5) The 'flag.txt' reveals the flag to be `flag{W34k_P4ssw0rds_St4Nd_n0_Ch4nc3}`.
