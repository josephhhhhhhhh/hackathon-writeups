A PCAP file with many pings. Each ICMP Ping actually contains data in the payload part of the packet.

The data appears to be just numbers, letters (both capitals and lower case), and the + and / sign. The sequence ends with an ==.

This appears to be a base64 encoding of data. Thus the data was pasted into a decoder.

Decodes into a bunch of gibberish that contains words like "PNG", "IHDR", "Create Date" and "Modify Date". Seems like this is actually a PNG image file encoded with base64.\

Converting the data from base64 to PNG solves this. 

Note: The key to putting together the payloads requires manipulation of wireshark to put the relevant payload as a separate column, save that column as a CSV file, and then copying that column which basically combines the data. Remember to keep the column ordered by time.
