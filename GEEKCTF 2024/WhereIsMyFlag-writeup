Challenge: Find the flag given the repository -> https://github.com/awesome-ctf/2024-WhereIsMyFlag

Solution: I went about trying to analyse the python code and everything and I was so stumped for quite awhile.... until I realised they'd hid the relevant part in the python file by separating it from the normal code block with a lot of space. I only saw it because I looked at the commit history interface. There is a block of code:
` ;import gzip; import base64; gzip.decompress(base64.b64decode('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'))`

The above code appears to be a gzip decompression of some data that was encoded in base64. 

I used an online tool to convert base64 to a file binary. The output file however could not be run. Also, my Kali VM was detecting the output file as another gz. Turns out this whole file was multiple gz decompressions layered over the actual file content. After using a python script to count the number of compressions, I simply decompressed that number of times and printed the contents of the file to receive the flag. The flag is all the way at the bottom of the file: `flag{760671da3ca23cae060262190c01e575873c72e6}`
